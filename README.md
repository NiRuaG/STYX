# Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.

# Not Lanterns- the Game of Seven Sins
======

## Overview
------
This team-- our team is made up of people who love to game, laugh, and build. We all have experienced the desire to be in community and a part of a common humanity. Each person in this team has fulfilled these human essentials through joining each other in throwing down cards, strategizing, and stocking up points. This app we have created is both a representation and brainchild of this inspiration and we would like to share it with you. 

Not-Lanterns is a four-person online game based off the Mensa Select Winner board game, Lanterns, and the ancient Greek myth of the River Styx.  It has been said the River Styx dominates the underworld. It is the border between the world we live in and the underworld itself. Once the living pass away, their souls arrive on the shore of the River Styx. To cross into the underworld a payment of obulus (Greek coins) must be made to Charon, the ferryman who transports souls across the river directly to the underworld. Without this payment, the dead are left drifting on the shore for one hundred years. 

The goal is to cross into the underworld by gaining the most obulus, or points, by trading different combinations of the seven deadly sins aquired strategically throughout the game. The placement of one card can affect everyone's chances of crossing the River Styx. This game is rated for anyone older than 9 and teaches spacial reasoning, strategy, problem solving, and adapting to suprising situations.
